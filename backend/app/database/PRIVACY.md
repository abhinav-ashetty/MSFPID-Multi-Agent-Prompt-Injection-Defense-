# Privacy Considerations for AIShield Defender Persistence Layer

## Prompt Storage and Sensitivity

The AIShield Defender persistence layer stores the original prompts that are submitted for security analysis. These prompts may contain sensitive information, including but not limited to:

- Personally identifiable information (PII)
- Proprietary business information
- Authentication credentials or tokens
- Confidential communications
- Other sensitive data that users may not intend to persist

## Production Deployment Recommendations

For production deployments, consider the following privacy protections:

### 1. Encryption
- Enable database-level encryption for the SQLite file
- Consider using encrypted filesystems or storage solutions
- Implement application-level encryption for highly sensitive fields

### 2. Access Controls
- Restrict file system permissions on the database file
- Implement role-based access control for database access
- Audit database access and query logs

### 3. Data Minimization
- Consider storing only hashed or anonymized versions of prompts when full retention is not required
- Implement prompt truncation to store only relevant portions for security analysis
- Use data masking techniques for known sensitive patterns

### 4. Retention Policies
- Implement automated data deletion based on retention requirements
- Allow users to request deletion of their data (right to be forgotten)
- Archive old data to secure, access-controlled storage

### 5. Secure Configuration
- Ensure the database file is not accessible via web server
- Use environment variables or secure secrets management for configuration
- Regularly update and patch dependencies

## Current Prototype Limitations

This prototype implementation uses local SQLite with the following characteristics:

- **Storage Location**: `backend/data/aishield.db` (relative to application root)
- **Access**: File-based access to SQLite database
- **Encryption**: None (plain text SQLite file)
- **Access Controls**: Dependent on file system permissions
- **Retention**: Infinite (data persists until manually deleted)

## Stored Data Fields

The persistence layer stores the following fields from each security assessment:

1. **Original Prompt**: The exact text submitted for analysis (potentially sensitive)
2. **Assessment Results**: Decision, scores, confidence, and reasoning
3. **Metadata**: Timestamp and optional detector details

## Compliance Considerations

Organizations using this persistence layer should consider applicable regulations:

- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) for EU data subjects
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) for California residents
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) for health information
- SOC 2, ISO 27001, or other industry-specific standards

## Recommendations for Secure Usage

1. **Environment Isolation**: Run the defender service in a secured, isolated environment
2. **Network Security**: Ensure the host system is properly firewalled and monitored
3. **Backup Security**: Encrypt backups and apply same access controls to backup files
4. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and alerting for suspicious database access patterns
5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review stored data and delete what is no longer needed
